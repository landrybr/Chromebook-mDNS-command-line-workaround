Workaround for command line mDNS .local name resolution in ChromeOS

For some reason ChromeOS doesn't support .local mDNS name resolution even though avahi is running.  Someone pointed this out in 2011, but it's still not solved as of (March 2017).  
(See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=199397
and https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=626377)

I believe that you can solve this problem by editing /etc/nsswitch.conf and adding:
mdns_minimal [NOUTFOUND=return]
to the hosts line, although I have not tried this.  This would require removing verification on the root filesystem, which can lead to its own problems (It can cause auto-updates to fail).


As a result of all of this I decided to make a simple work around that uses the built-in avahi-resolve-hostname as part of an awk-based script.

Usage:
bash run_command_check_avahi.sh ping mydomain.local

The smart way to use it is to make aliases in your /home/chronos/user/.bashrc file.
E.g.
alias ping="/bin/bash /home/chronos/user/scripts/run_command_check_avahi.sh ping"
alias ssh="/bin/bash /home/chronos/user/scripts/run_command_check_avahi.sh ssh"
alias scp="/bin/bash /home/chronos/user/scripts/run_command_check_avahi.sh scp"

(I put the script in a directory named scripts, but obviously you can put in anywhere you want.)
